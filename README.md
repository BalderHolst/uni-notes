## Installation
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BalderHolst/uni-notes/main/install.sh | bash
```
This is a simple script that clones this repo and installs my settings from the [settings repository](https://github.com/BalderHolst/uni-notes-settings). If you have already cloned this repo, you can also install settings automatically by running the `install.sh` script locally.
