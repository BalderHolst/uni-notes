# Interupts
An alternative to [[Pooling|pooling]]. Allows the CPU to run a routine when an external device sends an interrupt request. The CPU will return to the normal program after the interrupt is executed.

Microcontrolers usually have designated interrupt pins.

All interrupts can be enabled/disabled by the *global interrupt*.
