# Signal Bandwidth
The bandwidth of a closed loop system $T(s)$ is the *maximum frequency* at which the output $y$ of a system will track a sunusoidal input $r$ in a satisfactory manner.

The bandwith $\omega_{BW}$ of $T(s)$ is the maximal frequency such that:
$$
T(j \omega ) \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \s \forall \omega \in \omega_{BW}
$$
