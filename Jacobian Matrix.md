# Jacobian Matrix
>*"The jacobian matrix is the matrix representing the best linear map approximation of $f$ near $(a,b)$"*
>\- [What is Jacobian?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCZ1VEmVjVo)

A matrix describing the linear transformation around a point $p$. It consists of *scaling factors* that scale the original space around $p$. The jacobian ran be **different around different points $p$**.
