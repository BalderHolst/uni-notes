# Jacobian Matrix
>*"The jacobian matrix is the matrix representing the best linear map approximation of $f$ near $(a,b)$"*

$$
J =
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x}|_{(a,b)} & \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial y}|_{(a,b)} \\
\frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x}|_{(a,b)} & \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial y}|_{(a,b)}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
