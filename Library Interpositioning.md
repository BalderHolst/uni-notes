# Library Interpositioning
The practice of swapping out library functions called by a program.

This can be done in three stages:
- **Compile-time**: By redefining functions.
- **Link-time**: By changing the order of libraries during linking.
- **Runtime**: Using environment variables like `LD_PRELOAD`
