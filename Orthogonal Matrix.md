# Orthogonal Matrix
A special matrix such that
$$
AA^{T} = A^{T}A = I \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad A^{-1} = A^T
$$
Using a as a linear transformation does not change the length of the input vector, and angles between transformed vectors are preserved.
$$
||Ax|| = ||x||
$$
$$
\mathrm{angle}(x, y) = \mathrm{angle}(Ax, Ay)
$$
