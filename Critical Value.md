# Critical Value
The value that defines the upper and lower bounds of a [[confidence interval]].

### Calculating
Find the critical value by solving for $C$.
$$
z = \frac{C - \mu_{0}}{\mathrm{se}} = \frac{C - \mu_{0}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
$C$: Critical Value
$z$: The point on the [[Z-distribution]] that corresponds to the confidence level $\alpha$. This is usually found in a lookup table.
$\mu_{0}$: The mean given the *null hypothesis*
$\sigma$: Standard deviation
$n$: Number of samples
