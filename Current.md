# Current
The flow of charge

Unit: 
$$A = \frac{C}{s}$$

### Charge
Current is the derivative of charge
$$i(t) = q'(t)$$
Therefore, to calculate the charge passing through a component, we can integrate:
$$\int_{t_0}^t i(t) dt$$
$i(t)$: Current over time



### Current
> "The current entering a node must equal the current exiting a node"

If this was not true, charge would accumulate in some nodes, whilst being absent from others. Because of charge's tendency to attract opposites imbalance evens out.
