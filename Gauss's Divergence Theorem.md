# Gauss's Divergence Theorem

Calculating the flux imposed by a [[Vector Fields|vector field]] in a volume.

$$\iint_{S} \vec{F} \bullet \vec{n}\ \mathrm{dS} = \iiint_{V} \vec{\nabla} \bullet \vec{F}\ \mathrm{dV}$$
> *"The flux of a vector field $\vec{F}$ through a closed surface $S$ is equal to the integral of the [[Divergence|divergence]] $\mathbf{div}\ \vec{F}$ over the entire enclosed volume $V$"*

#### Flux
Flux is *how much of $\vec{F}$ is pointing in the **normal direction***. This can be calculated with a dot product.
