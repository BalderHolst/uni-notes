### Triumvirat


Triumvirat, tremandskollegium, som varetog dele af romersk administration, fx møntudstedelse.

Betegnelsen benyttes også om tremandsgrupper, nedsat af staten til at løse bestemte opgaver, fx det såkaldte 2. triumvirat, som bestod af Octavian (den senere Augustus), Marcus Antonius og Lepidus. Dette triumvirat nedsattes ved lov i 43 f.Kr. med det formål i løbet af de næste fem år at "genoprette staten" efter mordet på Cæsar.

Det såkaldte 1. triumvirat var derimod nedsat efter en privat aftale indgået i 60 f.Kr. mellem Cæsar, Crassus og Pompejus med det formål at fastlægge en indbyrdes magtdeling af riget.

### 1. Triumvirat (wikipedia)
The **First Triumvirate**[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Triumvirate#cite_note-2) (60–53 BC) was an informal alliance among three prominent politicians in the late [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic"): [Gaius Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar "Julius Caesar"), [Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey "Pompey") and [Marcus Licinius Crassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus "Marcus Licinius Crassus").

The [constitution of the Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Roman_Republic "Constitution of the Roman Republic") was a complex set of [checks and balances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers "Separation of powers") designed to prevent a man from rising above the rest and creating a monarchy. In order to bypass these constitutional obstacles, Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus forged a secret alliance in which they promised to use their respective influence to help each other. According to [Goldsworthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Goldsworthy "Adrian Goldsworthy"), the alliance was "not at heart a union of those with the same political ideals and ambitions", but one where "all [were] seeking personal advantage".

As the nephew of [Gaius Marius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Marius "Gaius Marius"), Caesar was at the time very well connected with the [populares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populares "Populares") faction, which pushed for social reforms. He was moreover _[pontifex maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifex_maximus "Pontifex maximus")_—the chief priest in the [Roman religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome "Religion in ancient Rome")—and could significantly influence politics (notably through the interpretation of the [auspices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augury "Augury")). Pompey was the greatest military leader of the time, having won the wars against [Sertorius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertorian_War "Sertorian War") (80–72 BC), [Mithridates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Mithridatic_War "Third Mithridatic War") (73–63 BC), and the [Cilician pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilician_pirates "Cilician pirates") (66 BC). Although he won the war against [Spartacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Servile_War "Third Servile War") (73–71 BC), Crassus was mostly known for his fabulous wealth, which he acquired through intense land speculation. Both Pompey and Crassus also had extensive patronage networks. The alliance was cemented with Pompey's marriage to Caesar's daughter [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(daughter_of_Caesar) "Julia (daughter of Caesar)") in 59 BC. Thanks to the alliance, Caesar received an extraordinary command over [Gaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul "Gaul") and [Illyria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyria "Illyria") for five years, so he could start his [conquest of Gaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars "Gallic Wars"). In 56 BC, the Triumvirate was renewed at the [Lucca Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucca_Conference "Lucca Conference"), in which the triumvirs agreed to share the Roman provinces between them; Caesar could keep Gaul for another five years, while Pompey received [Hispania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispania "Hispania") and Crassus [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Syria "Roman Syria"). Crassus embarked on an expedition against the [Parthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire "Parthian Empire") to match Caesar's victories in Gaul but died in the disastrous defeat of [Carrhae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carrhae "Battle of Carrhae") in 53 BC.

The death of Crassus ended the Triumvirate and left Caesar and Pompey facing each other; their relationship had already degraded after the death of Julia in 54 BC. Pompey then sided with the [optimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates "Optimates"), the conservative faction opposed to the Populares, and actively fought Caesar in the [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Roman_Republic "Senate of the Roman Republic"). In 49 BC, with the conquest of Gaul complete, Caesar refused to release his legions and instead invaded Italy from the north by [crossing the Rubicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Rubicon "Crossing the Rubicon") with his army. The following [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Civil_War "Caesar's Civil War") eventually led to Caesar's victory over Pompey at the [Battle of Pharsalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pharsalus "Battle of Pharsalus") in 48 BC and the latter's assassination in [Ptolemaic Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Egypt "Ptolemaic Egypt"), where he fled after the battle. In 44 BC, [Caesar was assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar "Assassination of Julius Caesar") in Rome and the following year his adopted son [Octavian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavian "Octavian") (later known as [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus "Augustus")) formed the [Second Triumvirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Triumvirate "Second Triumvirate") with [Mark Antony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Antony "Mark Antony") and [Marcus Aemilius Lepidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus_(triumvir) "Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)").k
