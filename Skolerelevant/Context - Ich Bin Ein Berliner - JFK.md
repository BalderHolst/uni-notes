[[Germany]] was at war with everyone. After the war. Germany was divided between [[United States Of America|USA]], [[Brittan]], [[France]] and [[Russia]]. Berlin was also divided. Russia needed to protect itself from the Western world, because of the prior offences from Germany, so all the communist formed an alliance. As did the western countries: NATO. The Soviet Union was irritated that there were capitalists on "their" communist land. The allies invested in Germany: Marcial help. The Soviets wanted compensation, so they took production from Germany, making the soviet side of Germany much pourer than the western Germany. Therefore, people moved from east to west. The Soviet Union blocked the supply of goods to west Berlin. 1948: The allies then flew all supplies to west Berlin. The public therefore liked the Allies. The soviets stopped the blockade.

People fled from east to west. August 1961: The government in east Berlin build a wall trough Berlin to hold their citizens in.
