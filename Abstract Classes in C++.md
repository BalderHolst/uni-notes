# Abstract Classes in C++
A base class which cannot be instantiated by itself. This is accomplished by declarations without definitions in the abstract class. An abstract class *has at least one purely virtual method*.

**Purpose**: Force all classes that inherits from the abstract class to implement its methods.

Used for defining [[Interfaces in C++|interfaces]].
