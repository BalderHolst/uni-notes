# Gain Margins

We look for when the loop transfer function crosses the neutral stability threshold and becomes unstable.
$$
|L(s)| = 1 \quad \angle L(s) = 180\degree
$$

## Bode Plot
Draw [[Notes/Bode Plot|Bode Plot]] for loop amplification.
1. Look where phase is $180\degree$
2. Look at the same place in the amplitude plot and read the difference from $0dB$ to get $GM$ (gain margin).
3. The phase margin is read in the phase plot where the amplitude plot is $0\ \mathrm{dB}$ to find $PM$ (phase margin).
