# Vector Fields
A way of representing functions with $2$- or $3$-dimensional inputs and outputs.

The coordinate system is the input space and the output is shown as vectors from a subset of the infinite points in the input space.

### Conservative Fields
>*"When a scalar function can be converted into a vector field using a [[Gradient|gradient]]."*
>\- Cornelia's Notes

**Conditions:**
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial y} =  \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x}, \\
\frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial z} =  \frac{\partial f_{3}}{\partial x}, \\
\frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial z} =  \frac{\partial f_{3}}{\partial y},
\end{align}
$$
