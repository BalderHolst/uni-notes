# Data Communication

### Aspects of Protocols
**Syntax**: The *format/structure* of the data.
**Semantics**: How the recipient *understands* the data.
**Timing**: How fast data should be sent or recieved.

Protocols are usually organised in *layers*, as it allows for easier debugging. The bottom layer is always physical, meaning wires, components and their connections.
