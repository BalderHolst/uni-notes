# The Heat Equation
How heat distributed in a rod changes over time. Each point tends towards the average of its neighbours.

This **also works for multiple dimensions**.

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \cdot \nabla^{2} u, \s \alpha = \frac{k}{c\rho}$$
$t$: Time
$u$: Temperature as a function of position and time.
$k$: Therm
