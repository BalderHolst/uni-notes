# Dirac Delta Function
A signal with infinite magnitude over an infinitely small time span. Its integral is equal to $1$.

All signals can be described as a weighted average of Dirac Delta functions.
$$
y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}u(\tau) h(t, \tau)\, d\tau
$$

For [[Linear Systems]] this also applies:
$$
y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}u(t - \tau) h(\tau)\, d\tau
$$
