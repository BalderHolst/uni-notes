### Digital Multiplexer
The input is **never directly connected to the output**, but is derived from the input.

### Analog Multiplexer
The input is connected **directly connected** to the output is enabled.

This can be implemented with [[Tri-State Buffer|tri-state buffers]] like on [[Lesson 3.pdf#page=29|this]] slide.
