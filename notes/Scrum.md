# Scrum
> *Scrum is an experimental approach to software development.*

It is hard to develop a program top-down. Meaning structuring everything from the beginning and then implementing it. Scrum is therefore a bottom-up way to develop software.

Scum is used together with strategies like [[Extreme Programming]] for [[Unified Process]].
