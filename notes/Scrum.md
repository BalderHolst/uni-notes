# Scrum

It is hard to develop a program top-down. Meaning structuring everything from the beginning and then implementing it. Scrum is therefore a bottom-up way to develop software.


## Steps
1. Inception - find requirements, state business case
2. Elaboration - define system architecture
3. Construction - Construct the system
4. Transition - Deploy the system into the real world
