# Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law
$$\sum I = 0 \s\text{towards every node}$$
> "The current entering a node must equal the current exiting a node"

If this was not true, charge would accumulate in some nodes, whilst being absent from others. Because of charge's tendency to attract opposites imbalance evens out.

### Method
1. Assign negative values to **outgoing current**, and **positive to incoming**.
ex: $I_{in} + I_{in} - I_{out} = 0$

2. solve!
Ex: $I_{out} = I_{in} + I_{in}$
