# Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
>*"A partial differential equation relates multivariate functions and their partial derivatives."*
> \- Mr. Math Man

$$u(\mathbf{x},t)$$
$u$: unknown function
$\mathbf{x}$: position in space (can be multi-dimensional)
$t$: time
##### Subscripts
Partial derivatives can be denoted with subscripts like this:
$$
\begin{align}
u_{t} &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \\
u_{xx} &= \frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial x^{2}}
\end{align}
$$

### Common types of PDEs
**Linear**: No products between $u$, $u_{x}$,$u_{xx}$...
**2nd order**: No derivatives higher than 2nd order.
**Homogeneous**: No time or space dependent forcing.



>[!example]- Function moving in space over time
>$$\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial t^{2}} = c^{2} \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}$$
