There was the first spring-quickening in the air this morning as I
walked to Luke\'s for breakfast: A watery sun warmed the sea breeze, the
day was mild with a light blue sky up above. However, any elation I felt
was dissipated when I got to Luke\'s. There was no sign of the old man
and the place was a real toilet. I sat at my usual table and waited for
Loretta to come and clear it up. It was swimming with spilt coffee, the
ashtray was full of butts and someone had ground out a cigar in a half
eaten plate of pancakes and syrup. Loretta wore a loose Hawaiian blouse
and stretch slacks in honour of the clement weather. She sat down and
chatted and offered me one of the menthol cigarettes she chain smokes so
I guessed I must have been forgiven. Then she leant right over in front
of me while she cleared the table so I could get a good look down her
front at her heavy breasts. I ordered a hot tea, no milk, with a slice
of lemon. It may have been warmer outside but Loretta wasn't taking any
chances. All the windows were tight shut and their-film of condensation
and grease obscured any view of the beach.

I heard a car pull up. I wiped the window and peered out. It was
a-battered convertible and there were three guys inside. They got out
and stretched, rubbing their buttocks and looking around. They were
young; two whites and a Hispanic. There was a thin one with a pimp\'s
moustachio and a thick-lipped, black-haired guy with oddly white
tattooed arms. They were wearing worn out sharpie clothes. This is a
quiet little town we live in and I hoped they\'d just move on through.
But just then the sun came out from behind some clouds and, in the
corner of my eye, I caught its flash on the girl\'s white T-shirt. It
was the first time I\'d seen her that day and I wiped the window some
more to get a better look. But they saw her too and they glanced at each
other and laughed in that shifty teeth-baring way men in a group have.
One of them bent his arm and did something with his fingers while the
thick-lipped guy cupped his hands over his crotch and groaned. They all
laughed again. I felt my face flush and a pulse beat at my temples. When
I put my cup down in its saucer there was a rattle of china. They
disgust me, this kind of filth. City scum degenerates, just drifting up
the coast in a hot car looking for cheap kicks.

I spent the rest of the day in my room reading my magazines. Later I
tried to sleep but 1 had developed a bad headache. In the afternoon I
had a long shower. That made me feel a little better. At dusk I went to
a small supermarket that I sometimes buy provisions at when I don\'t
feel like going out to eat. I was reaching for a tin of clam chowder
when I saw the girl through the window. I was a little surprised.
Usually I never managed to see her this late and I always wondered where
she went. But tonight it was obvious --her eyes were gazing out to sea,
her easy stride would carry her determinedly down to the beach.

The clam chowder tasted like earth. I couldn\'t clear my mouth of it so
I drank a glass or two of rye. I opened the window that gives me a sea
view and sat on the sill looking out at the darkening waters. Quite a
way along the beach I could see the glimmer of a campfire burning and I
knew at once that was where the girl would be - out there alone. Maybe
she had cooked something and was enjoying the peace and absolute
solitude. Then I could imagine her stripping off her clothes, her tan
body with white bikini patches maybe, paler in the gloom, the breeze
tensing her nut-brown nipples, the cool of the water as the waves broke
against her golden thighs . . .

But then I was distracted by the noise of raucous laugh­ter in the
street below. The three youths, half bombed, spilling out of the liquor
store clutching six-packs and a bottle of wine. With a bizarre sense of
mounting premonition I watched them laughing and joshing for a while in
the street. Then one of them said \'Hey, look. A fire.\' And with
whistles and whoops they went running down the board­ walk, all heroic
with beer, jumping gleefully onto the sand and heading up the beach
towards my girl.

For an instant I heard my heart booming in my skull and my eyeballs
seemed to bulge rhythmically to its beat. With a forefinger I wiped
beads of perspiration from my upper lip. Bastards! SCUM TRASH BASTARDS!
I saw stubby stained fingers fondling corn-yellow hair, spectral
tattooed arms circling her slim brown body, probing tongue between thick
dabbing lips, young beards on soft skin. She\'d come dripping from the
surf, wading quietly out of the green sea, her body dim and mysterious,
to find a leering drunken horror waiting round her fire. I felt the
sharp taste of vomit in my throat for I was almost sick with a desperate
fear and anxiety as I rummaged in my bureau for my gun, an old police
special. I was sick with insane visions of the fabulous lusts of
nightmare hooligans, terrible images of deviant sex dreams being foully
realized out there on the lonely coast.

I came up behind them through the dunes, my feet silent on the sand. The
three of them sat around the fire drunk. One of them was singing quietly
to himself. Discarded beer cans lay like shell cases round a gun
emplacement. There was no sign of the girl. They heard the sound of my
feet as I crossed the strip of pebbles that lay above the high-tide
mark. \'Hey, man,\' the thick-lipped one said. \'Whatcha doin\'? Have a
drink. Luis, give . . .\' Then he saw the gun. His jaw slackened as his
beer­- numbed brain tried to cope with what was happening.

> \'C\'mon, what gives!\' There was a smile of disbelief on his face.
> The other two began to edge away from me. \'Where is she?\' I said, my
> voice shaking with rage and disgust. I raised my eyes looking for
> sighs of a shallow grave, half expecting to see her violated body cast
> up on the beach by the waves. \'What have you filth done with her?
> Where is she? Where have you put her?\' He stood up shakily, an
> uncertain smile on his face. He looked round at his friends for
> support. \'Who, man?\' he said, shrugging his shoulders. \'For
> chrissake, who?\' *\'My girl!*\' I screamed at him, maddened by his
> feeble attempts to protest his innocence. \'My sweet girl, you
> bastard!\'

\'We ain\'t seen no friggin girl, man,\' he shouted back, arcs of
spittle flying from his lips. The waves seemed to be crashing and
breaking in my head as I levelled the gun at his denimmed groin and
pulled the trigger. I missed, but the bullet tore off a chunk of his
thigh which splashed a bright red in the firelight. He screamed with the
pain and went down. When the sound of the waves and the echoes of the
shot had diminished I heard the rattle of pebbles as his two friends ran
off.

Thick-lips was crawling painfully down the sand towards the sea. One leg
of his jeans was damp and left a trail like a slug. He was making little
whimpering noises. \'I\'ll give you one last chance,\' I shouted after
him. \'Tell me where she is' He said nothing. I pocketed the gun and
picked up a piece of driftwood about the size of a baseball bat. I
weighed it in my hand, swishing it gently through the air to get my grip
right. Then I walked down the beach to thick-lips and with five or six
firm strokes battered his head into the wet sand at the surf edge. The
foam went pink like a milk shake.

When it was over I pushed him well out into the breakers. The tide was
ebbing and it would be a couple of days before he washed up again. Then
I stood on the beach and shouted out into the waves just in case she was
out there. \'It\'s okay,\' I shouted. \'You can come out. They\'ve
gone.\' But she never appeared.

When I woke up the next morning I knew instinctively she had gone
forever and for a moment I felt the sadness of her passing intensely. I
went to the window and opened it and took a few deep breaths. Across the
street a man was working on the billboard. Distracted, I began to admire
the way his hand led the huge cumbersome folds of paper, his dexterity
in spreading the sheets so accurately and with such little fuss, the
precision with which he manipulated the long sopping brush. And, as the
new advertisement took shape, I found I was forgetting about the girl as
she disappeared, with her impossibly white T-shirt and her ludicrously
skin-tight jeans. I stood there at the window a while, just looking.
Yes, I thought to myself. Yes. Definitely my kind of drink. Mellow, with
the real tawny glow . . .
