This resource has been designed as a guide for teachers to use in the
classroom when teaching students how to analyse a film as a text.

CHARACTERISATION

**Character Mapping**

A character-mapping exercise can often help us understand how filmmakers
have developed a character.

1\. **View the film**, then use a table (such as the one on the
following page), to record notes about the personalities of the main
characters.

2\. **You might also consider a range of secondary characters** and
their narrative purpose. Think about how each character is represented
then discuss:

**Appearance/physical attributes**: How is the character presented
visually via facial look, body shape and costuming? What do these
attributes suggest about the character?

**Design**: How does the design of the character help to achieve
believability? How does design encourage the audience to feel empathy
for the character?

**Voice**: How do the character's words and voice (tone, inflection and
timbre) help to establish the character? What does it suggest about the
character?

**Action:** How do the character's actions and behaviours help to
establish the character? What other personal traits are evident?
Describe the character's motivations, fears and desires.

**Role:** How does the character relate to the other characters? What
effects does the character's behaviour have? Describe the character's
role in the overall storyline.

**Framing:** Where is the character placed in the frame? What else is
placed in the frame with the character? What shot types and angles are
used?

NARRATIVE

**Setting**

How does the setting relate to the narrative? In other words, why has a
background, location or set for a particular scene/sequence been chosen?

Are any of the props significant?\
How do the mood and ambience of the setting create meanings for an
audience?

**Structuring of Time**

Investigate how the narrative manipulates time. How are events ordered?
For instance, are events chronological, or does the film use flashbacks
or flash forwards?

Explore the duration of events - that is, the expansion or contraction
of time.

How frequently are events or scenes shown in comparison with their
presumed occurrence and existence?

**Point of View (POV) from which the Narrative is Presented**

From whose POV is the narrative presented?

Do we see the narrative through one character's eyes or more than one?
Why? What are the effects of this?

Is the POV different from that of the other characters? What is the
effect of this?

What story information is given or withheld at different points in the
narrative? What effect does this have?

How is POV technically communicated to an audience?

**Cause and Effect**

What motivates the characters?

What events are motivated by character?\
If there are natural or supernatural causes, what are their
consequences?

**Opening and Closure**

Are conflicts, motivations and issues resolved or unresolved by the end
of the film?

height="0.18055555555555555in"}

What expectations are established in the beginning and resolved or
remain unresolved at the end?

How are character developments, themes/issues and resolutions dealt with
in the closing sequences?

**Narration**

Why do we have a narrator?

Comment on the tone and the rhythm of the narration.

**Themes and Issues**

What themes and issues are introduced and how are they developed and
explored?

Are certain themes and issues exclusively related to particular
characters? How do the themes and issues work in with the storyline?

CLOSE ANALYSIS: PRODUCTION ELEMENTS

**Camera Work**

**Angle** (high, low, eye level, aerial) and movement of shots
(shot-reverse-shot, panning, tracking, tilting).

**Distance of shots** (i.e. close-up, mid shots, long shots and extremes
of this), shot size and camera movement.

**Duration of shot on screen**: what impact does the concentration of
the length of a shot have on the audience?

**What meaning is created for an audience** by using different shot
sizes, movement and camera angles?

**How does the camerawork inform the audience about a character's
motivations,** create identification with characters and communicate
their relationship to the story?

How is an **audience's engagement** with the narrative created by the
choice of camerawork?

**Lighting**

Is the lighting natural/artificial, realistic or expressive? How does it
set a mood or create an atmosphere?

Why and how effective is this?\
Are any lighting effects used, for example, to emphasis an object, a
character or an action?

*der var et billede her engang*
*der var et billede her engang*
*der var et billede her engang*
*der var et billede her engang*
*der var et billede her engang*
*der var et billede her engang*

Explain.

**Mise-en-Scène**

The way each shot is composed within the frame has an effect on the way
we respond to the narrative. Composition relates to the production
elements and story elements.\
Look at how the following aspects of composition are arranged in
particular scenes or in a sequence:

Setting and set design

Costumes and objects

Colours

Arrangement and movement within the frame\
Spatial relations between objects and characters (spacing)\
Framing: how is the shot framed, that is how is it positioned within the
square of the frame?

**Freeze-Frame a Scene**

For a clear analysis of mise-en-scène, freeze-frame on a selected scene
and discuss the mise-en-scène and its relationship to the narrative.
Consider the following in your discussion and analysis:

Lighting: how are shadows and patterns used to create mood, atmosphere
and meanings? Framing: What is in the frame? What has been left out?\
Placement of objects: How are objects placed within the frame and why?\
Setting/location: Where is the action located and why?

Where are the characters placed within the frame and why.

**Editing**

**Sound**

How do placement, timing, and the rhythm of the editing affect the mood
of a sequence and the mood of the overall film?

How do the shots relate to each other visually and aurally -- image to
image, sound to sound, image to sound?

Listen to the sound of the film. How is atmosphere created via the sound
design? Consider the music, sound effects (including atmospheric sound)
and what they convey.

Look at the way any dialogue or narration is recorded.

How does the soundtrack relate to the storylines, themes and issues of
the narrative, characters and plot? Focus on both diegetic and
non-diegetic sound.

Reflect on the use of music -- how does it add to the meanings
associated with each character? How has music been used to support
themes?

How do the layers (atmosphere, dialogue, sound effects and music) work
together to create the sound design?

Are there any special or unconventional applications and explorations of
sound design? Explain.

**Acting/Performance**

How does the actor's performance contribute to the characterisation?

Does the actor bring associations from outside the narrative to the
character?

What effect does this create in terms of character
believability/acceptance?

Does an audience have empathy for the characters? How is this achieved?
Are there characters that repel the audience? Why?
