> **Types of story ending**

1.  **Explicit ending** -- This is the ending that wraps everything up
    and answers all the questions. This ending will frequently tell what
    happens to each of the major characters, and is usually very
    satisfying in its completeness. Particularly well suited for novels
    (over short stories), when using this ending, it is especially
    important to watch for plot holes and missing clues. Example:
    [[*Watership Down* by Richard
    Adams]{.ul}](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down).

2.  **Implicit ending** -- If you like an ending that is strongly based
    on interpretation, then you like implicit endings. These endings are
    more common in short fiction. An example is [[*The Nine Billion
    Names of God* by Arthur C.
    Clark]{.ul}](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Billion_Names_of_God).

3.  **Twist ending** -- As the name implies, this ending is unexpected
    or twisted. As a writer, everything you've led your reader to
    believe gets thrown out at the end, and is replaced by a new
    revelation when well done. If done poorly, your reader will feel
    cheated. The TV show [*[The Twilight
    Zone]{.ul}*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone) was
    known for it's twist endings.

4.  **Tie-back ending** -- This ending ties the end of the story back to
    clues planted in the beginning. The example provided in the endings
    class is the short story entitled [[*The Star* by Arthur C.
    Clark]{.ul}](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_%28short_story%29),
    where the story opens with what the main character's conflict is and
    ends with why.

5.  **Unresolved ending** -- In unresolved endings, the main conflicts
    are left unanswered, such as in [[The Lady, or the Tiger by Frank R.
    Stockton]{.ul}](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady,_or_the_Tiger%3F).
    The reader is left to ponder the outcome. Cliffhanger endings would
    also fall under this category.

6.  **Long view ending** -- These endings tell what happens to the
    characters a significant timeframe into the future. An example is
    [[*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* by J.K.
    Rowling]{.ul}](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows),
    which ends telling who married whom, who had kids, etc. out into the
    future.

Novels have to end, and in a way that isn't predictable yet is
satisfying to the reader. Endings tie up loose threads, unless you're
writing literary fiction, which allows for more ambiguity. Rules for
writing endings can barely exist, because endings are tied to the unique
story elements of each novel. Your imaginative powers will be tested
most when it comes eto creating a satisfying conclusion.

Beginnings are easy. Endings are hard.

But it will help if you know the five types of endings:

1.  The Lead gains his objective (the happy ending).

2.  The Lead loses his objective (unhappy ending).

3.  The Lead gains his objective but loses something more valuable
    (classic tragedy).

4.  The Lead sacrifices his objective for a greater good.

5.  The ending is ambiguous or bittersweet (mostly for literary
    fiction).
