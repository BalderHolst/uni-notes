1.  **Determine the kind of text (short story / novel) and the sub-genre
    (young adult fiction/crime fiction/realistic (real life issues,
    everyday life)**

-   Du skal **ikke** igennem samtlige punkter i analysemodellen! 

-   Vælg de mest interessante ud og gå i dybden med dem - især dem, som
    du forventer at komme ind på i din fortolkning.

-    **Personkarakteristik (characterisation)**, er næsten altid
    relevant uanset hvilken novelle du arbejder med.

2.  **Composition in Fiction**

-   How does the story start? From the beginning? From the beginning
*der var et billede her engang*

-   Is there any use of flashbacks or flashforward?

Is it a chronological story or a framed story? (**Frame story
is** a **story** set within a **story**, **narrative**, or movie, told
by the main or the supporting character. A character starts telling
a **story** to other characters, or he sits down to write a **story**,
telling the details to the audience.)

3.  **Describe the setting and analyse the atmosphere. *(where and when
    the story takes place. ***

> A setting can be physical*:*

-   *Historical time, season, time of the day etc.*

-   *Nation, country, city, in the countryside, ocean, forest,
    mountains.*

-   *Environment influenced by social class, age group ethnic group.*

-   *Fantasy or realistic environment*

*You have to consider what role the physical setting plays in the story.
Is it an important part of the plot or theme? Or is it just a backdrop
against which the action takes place?*

However, setting is not only a physical description of a place connected
to the story. It can also set the mood of the story. **Mood** is the
feeling the story creates in the reader such as happy, sad or scared. It
is created by giving the reader images of the setting creating a certain
feeling/mood in the reader. By choosing specific words and by weaving
their connotations together, it is possible for the author to give the
setting a particular atmosphere.

**Example of connotation**

Example 1: A beautiful red rose with a sweet smell of summer

Example 2: A red rose with thorns of needles.

Mood words are descriptive adjectives and verbs that help build an
**atmosphere**. When you analyse a text you can look for such words and
see which atmosphere they create in the text.

**Suspense mood words:** Creaky, tip-toe, rattling, whistling of the
wind, stormy, dark

**Happy mood words:** Amused, calm, cheerful, confident, content,
determined, dignified, dreamy, ecstatic, excited, grateful, harmonious,
hopeful, hyper, idyllic, joyous, light-hearted, loving, mellow,
nostalgic, optimistic, passionate, peaceful, playful, pleased, relaxed,
satisfied, sentimental, silly, surprised, sympathetic, thankful,
thoughtful, warm, welcoming.

**Negative mood word:** Annoyed, anxious, apathetic, cold, confining,
confused, cranky, crushed, cynical, depressed, disappointed, drained,
dreary, embarrassed, enraged, envious, indifferent, infuriated,
intimidated, irritated, jealous, lethargic (sløv) lonely, melancholic,
moody, nervous, overwhelmed, painful, pessimistic, rejected, restless,
scared, sick, stressed, suspenseful, tense, terrifying, threatening,
uncomfortable, vengeful, violent, worried.

4.  **Determine the type of narrator** -- point of view

-   Where does the text reveal something about the narrator?

-   How does the narrator/ point of view influence what you get to know
    in the story e.g. about the characters and maybe setting?

[POINT OF VIEW]{.ul}:

Angle or perspective from which the story is told.

**First person** = \"I\" who is normally part of the plot.

A first person narrator\'s point of view is naturally limited, but it
may be broadened if, for example, he is looking back in time and so has
gathered further information about the events he narrates.

It is an I speaker and events are told through the eyes of the I
(subjective)

Only allows the reader to know what the I knows.

Can be a character in the story.

Can be a less important character witnessing events.

Can be a character re-telling a story he/she was told by someone else.

Gives a closeness to the character.

Makes it easier for the reader to identify with the character.

**Third person** = Is not a character in the story. Is an observer
outside the action so he/she sees the plot from the outside. Is referred
to as he/she. Makes it harder for the reader to identify with the
characters. Allows the reader to know the thoughts of all characters or
one character.

*[Omniscent:]{.ul} he knows everything and can be everywhere at the same
time. Knows what everyone thinks (and sometimes the author may make
his/her own comments).*

*[Limited point of view]{.ul}: e.g. to follow one of the characters,
whose thoughts and feelings he knows. Events are told through the eyes
of a specific character who only knows how he/she sees the world.*

Who is the narrator telling the story to? Is it simply to the imagined
reader or to a character within the text? The tone of voice changes
according to the addressee.

Is the narrator sympathetic or unsympathetic? Is he reliable or
unreliable?

Through whose eyes/consciousness do we observe things?

**Objective:** The story can be told where the third person narrator
only observes. It is almost like a camera observing events.

**Subjective:** The story can be subjective if the story is told through
a limited 3^rd^ person narrator -- one person.

[**NARRATIVE TECHNIQUE**:]{.ul}

(telling/reporting/or showing)

showing = dialogue

Is the narrator childish/educated/mature/silly?

Does the author change points of view from first to third person?

What kind of language is used to suggest the kind of person who is
spea­king?

5.  **Describe the main character(s) and analyze their behavior and
    relations to others.**

-   What does he/she look like?

-   How does he/she act?

-   What is his/her relations to others?

-   Is the main character's personality described directly or
    indirectly?

-   What are the values of the main character?

-   Is there any coherence between the personality of the main character
    and mood/atmosphere of the story?

**External characteristics**

-   Gender

-   Age

-   Appearance

-   Occupation

**Internal characteristics**

-   What feelings are dominant?

-   Anxiety

-   Bitterness

-   Happiness

-   Sorrow

-   Confusion etc.

Does the character's past affect him/her?

How does the character behave throughout the text?

Does his/her actions change throughout the story?

**Personal characteristics**

-   Patient

-   Ill-tempered

-   Shy

-   Emotional

-   Caring

-   Dominant

-   Naïve

-   Snobbish

-   Lazy etc.

-   Relationship to other people

**Values important to the main character**

-   Material possessions

-   Freedom

-   Honesty

-   Excitement

-   Challenge

-   Respect

-   Order

**Static:**

A static character remains the same throughout the story. Characters
with an already existing charismatic, appealing or heroic persona tend
NOT to change.

**Dynamic:**

A dynamic character develops through the story and it is what makes the
story compelling. Dynamic characters may go through life-changing
events. Some go through difficult trials or develop new qualities for
better or worse.

**Other character types:**

**Flat character:** No depth, no change

Round character: Complex character -- is not necessarily dynamic.

Stock character: Stereotypical characters such as a cowboy.

Protagonist: the main character of the story

Antagonist: Represents the opposite of the protagonist.

6.  **Is there a use of foreshadowing and if yes, what is the effect?**

> **Foreshadowing:** Is a literary device used by the author to hint at
> events which will happen later in the story. It dramatizes the story
> because the reader will know that something is going to happen without
> knowing what it is. Foreshadowing can occur both in setting or in the
> character's words or actions. It usually indicates that something bad
> is about to happen.

7.  **What is the theme and how is it expressed in the text?**

> A **theme** is the underlying topic or universal idea which the author
> wants to pass on to the reader through the text. Often, it is not
> expressed directly but the reader has to read between the lines and
> analyzing especially the setting and characters. Examples: Man vs.
> nature, Relationships (father/son, mother/daughter etc. , Culture
> Clashes, Prejudice, Gender, class, etc.

-   Don't forget to mention something about the **titl**e in your
    interpretation, because it is often tied to the theme in some way
    and often functions as a symbol of important themes.

8.  **How does the story end?**

> **Remember to substantiate your claims with quotes. It is all about
> what the text *tells* us and not what we believe.**

> **Comprehension**

1.  Determine the type of non-fiction text. (instruction manuals,
    academic books, newspaper articles, advertisements, blogs,
    encyclopedia entries etc.

> Newspapers: types of non-fiction are newspaper articles, feature
> articles, columns (klumme), editorials (ledende artikel), opinions,
> advertisements and blogs (online newspapers) They are often published
> for a general audience and their purpose is to inform the general
> public about current events of either international, national,
> regional or local character. Newpapers are usually published on a
> daily basis and some weekly. In newspapers there are examples of
> expository (forklarende) narrative (fortællende) and persuasive
> (overbevisende) writing. Newpapers such as the American *Huffington
> Post* rely solely (udelukkende) on online publishing.
>
> US newspapers: New York Times, Washington Times, Washington Post,
> Huffington Post, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times,
> New York Post, Boston Herald, Chicago-Sun Times.
>
> UK newspapers: The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Independent, The
> Times, the Financial Times, The Mirror, The Sun, The Daily Mail
>
> Broadsheet Newspaper characteristics:

-   Main focus on major national and international events

-   More fact than emotion

-   Longer sentences

-   Unbiased (upartisk) and clear language

-   Complicated vocabulary

Tabloid

-   Added focus on famous people, private lives and scandals

-   A mix of fact and emotion

-   Shorter sentences

-   Biased (partisk) and emotional language

-   Less complex vocabulary

Key characteristics of newspaper articles

-   Found in the beginning of the newspaper

-   Belongs to category: expository writing.

-   Main purpose is to inform.

-   Objective writing.

-   Has a certain structure.

-   Makes use of the structure: 1. Most Newsworthy info (who?, what?
    when? where? why? How?/ 2. Important details / 3. Other General Info
    (background info)

Key characteristics of feature articles

-   Not current news but can be news told with a new angle.

-   Are factual and require research.

-   Make use of literary techniques.

-   Do not make use of the structure: 1. Most Newsworthy info (who?,
    what? when? where? why? How?/ 2. Important details / 3. Other
    General Info (background info)

-   Can be subjective and more personal

-   Makes the reader connect to the story and feel a part of it.

Key characteristics of blogs

-   A defined audience

-   Attention grabbing headlines

-   Relevant content

-   Spark discussion

-   If it is a good blog it is well -written and give a reason to
    return.

2.  **Describe the communication situation**

> Sender:

-   Who is the sender?

-   What do you know about the sender? Occupation, Education,
    Qualification, Background, Political interests etc.

Message:

-   Which message/idea is being sent to the receiver?

-   When was it sent and where?

Channel

-   Which channel is being used? Newpaper / magazine / blog?

Receiver

-   Who is the intended receiver? (social group / education/ age group
    etc.

Now you have established the communication situation and can move on to
the analysis which primarily concerns how the message is presented
through the use of argumentation and discourse analysis.

> **2.Determine which rhetorical devices have been used and what the
> effect is concerning the message of the text.**

Analysis:

1.  Analyze the message/the text by looking at the language and sentence
    structure.

> Look at the sender's writing style -- choice of words and the way the
> sentences are constructed.

-   Which discourse has been used: verbs, nouns, positive or negative
    adjectives and what is their function?

-   Is the language easy or difficult to understand and where are there
    examples of that in the text? (Look at how sentences are structured.
    Do they mainly consist of main clauses (ledsætninger) or do they
    have a more difficult sentence structure with a number of
    subordinate clauses?) Are the words easy to understand or are there
    difficult words? How does the use of words influence the intended
    audience /the receiver?

-   Are there any symbols, metaphors or contrasts used and what is their
    effect?

-   What is the connotative and denotative meaning? (The denotative
    meaning of the word *chair* is a place to sit whereas the
    connotative meaning of the word *chair* can be *comfortable or
    uncomfortable* depending on the feeling the word evokes (påkalder)
    in a person. (often based on the person's experiences. Denotative =
    the exact meaning and Connotative = the idea or feeling a word
    invokes in a person. \-\--Do these words have an impact on the
    message?

-   Is the language in the text persuasive, expository or narrative?

-   Expository: (forklarende) writing: Used for non-fiction texts where
    the *main purpose (formal) is to inform, educate or explain.* The
    author cannot assume that the reader knows anything about the topic
    in question. Therefore, these types of non-fiction texts often have
    a good structure so the reader knows what to expect and doesn't get
    confused. The words are not usually ambiguous (tvetydig) as it is
    important that the meaning of the text is clear to the reader.
    Newspaper articles, academic books, informational documentaries,
    company websites and reviews make use of this type of writing.

-   Narrative writing: used for non-fiction texts where the *main
    purpose is to entertain and to tell a story.* This type of writing
    includes characteristics from fiction such as characters, a plot and
    the story is built up in order to make it entertaining and
    interesting. Therefore, the reader cannot be absolutely sure that
    everything is based on facts. Non-fiction texts making use of
    narrative writing thereby mix non-fiction and fiction and this is
    often called literary nonfiction. Memoirs (erindringer), personal
    essays, news journalism, dramatized documentary, autobiographies
    (selvbiografi) and biographies make use of this type of writing.

-   Persuasive writing: Used for non-fiction texts where the *main
    purpose is to persuade (overbevise) the reader about something.* The
    author of a persuasive text uses words which are subjective in order
    to convince the reader of a certain claim. (påstand) Furthermore,
    persuasive texts may use facts such as research reports, statistics
    and expert opinions to support the validity (gyldighed) of the claim
    put forward. Political speeches, sermons (prædiken), personal
    development and self-help books as well as commercials, press
    releases and certain types of websites make use of this type of
    writing.

2.  **3. Find the main argument put forward by the sender and analyze
    them by using Toulmins's model of argumentation.**

> **The rhetorical pentagon**

3.  **The rhetorical pentagram is a useful tool for analysis of
    non-fiction texts.**\
    \
    Consider how each of the elements is linked to all the others:\
    \
*der var et billede her engang*
    height="2.008911854768154in"}

4.  **Text:** What genre is it (e.g. article, speech, essay, interview,
    propaganda)?\
    \
    **Speaker:** Who is the sender, what do we know about the sender's
    background, status, views etc.?\
    \
    **Circumstances:** What kind of communication is used (e.g. written
*der var et billede her engang*
    broadcast, the internet)? What does this mean to the communication
    between the sender and the audience?\
    \
    **Audience:** Who would be likely to be the receivers of the
    communication (age, sex, education, nationality, etc.)?\
    \
    **Language:**\
       • The structure of the text\
       • The wording of the introduction and conclusion\
       • The tone -- factual, pompous, humorous, admonitory etc.\
       • Use of rhetorical devices such as repetition, rhetorical
    questions, parallels, opposites\
       • Use of figurative language or connotations\
       • Use of quotations, intertextuality or references\
       • Types of arguments -- weak or strong?\
       • Use of logos/ethos/pathos appeal\
    \
    **Topic:** What themes are dealt with in the text? Toulmin's model
    of argumentation can be used to set up the main argument or message
    of it. How is the message substantiated? Is the presentation e.g.
    factual, reliable or emotive?\
    \
    **Intention:** Is the overall intention with the text to inform,
    influence, entertain, educate, convince -- or?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  4.Determine which rhetorical devices have been used and what the
    effect is concerning the message of the text.

> **Pathos:**
>
> A speaker uses pathos when he/she tries to persuade the audience by
> referring to emotions.
>
> A speaker can appeal to different kinds of emotions such as sympathy,
> hate, caring emotions, disgust.
>
> These emotions can be expressed through the use of words, the way the
> speaker uses his/her voice and non-verbal communication such as hand
> gestures and facial expressions.

**Logos:**

> A speaker uses logos when he/she tries to persuade by referring to
> something rational and logical such as statistics, numbers and facts.
>
> Logos can also be expressed through the use of words and the way the
> speaker uses her/her voice.

**Ethos**

A speaker uses ethos when persuading through his/her own character. The
intent is to appear credible (troværdig). This can be done through:

> Profession -- A professor of economics has ethos when he/she talks
> about economics but not if he/she talks about fashion.
>
> Choice of words used in order to convince the listener
>
> Non-verbal communication such as facial expressions.
>
> Referral to other experts

The use of other rhetorical devices such as:

**Allusion**: Reference to something the audience is believed to be
familiar with.

**Alliteration**: repetition of initial (først) consonant sound in two
or more words.

**Antithesis:** Opposition or contrast of words

**Rhetorical question**: Asking a question which will not be answered by
the audience but very often by the speaker him/herself.

**Anaphora:** Repetition of a word or phrase in successive
(efterfølgende) sentences.

**Metaphor**: A figure of speech where a word or phrase is used to
describe something by saying it is something else to suggest the
similarity.

**Similie**: Comparison by using *like* or *as.*

**Onomatopoeia**: The creation of words that imitate a natural sound --
"*kaboom"*The birds *"tweet"*

4.  **5. In the comprehension part you have determined which type of
    nonfiction genre the text is. Now you ask yourself why the sender
    has chosen this type of genre and how the genre affects the message
    and receiver?**

> **Interpretation**

1.  Does the sender succeed in reaching the intended receiver?

2.  Is the language, argumentation and genre encoded so the receiver can
    decode the message correctly?

3.  Is the sender reliable and does the sender have qualifications and
    background to talk about the subject?

> Remember to substantiate your claims with quotes. It is all about what

Opgavebesvarelsen og dens opbygning﻿

*5 gode råd til løsning af en eksamensopgave*:

1.  **Læs opgaveformuleringen grundigt og vær sikker på at du har
    forstået den.**

2.  **Læs materialet/teksten grundigt \-- flere gange \-- og overvej
    hvilken hjælp til forståelse du får fra opgaveformuleringen.**

3.  **Gør dig opgavens struktur klart, og overvej hvad du vil skrive
    hvor.**

4.  **Revidér: føj til og smid ud.**

5.  **Læs korrektur: ret dine fejl selv.**

-   Opgavens formål er at skrive et *analytical essay*, *hvilket i faget
    engelsk vil sige en analyserende artikel*, hvori du præsenterer en
    analyse af teksten, oftest med et eller to fokuspunkter.
    Dit* engelskfaglige arbejde* består altså i at *analysere, fortolke,
    kommentere og formidle*.

-   Modtageren er en læser der er bekendt med den tekst du skriver om

-   Struktur ‒ byg dit essay op over denne model:

*der var et billede her engang*
height="1.1270833333333334in"}

 \
Det er afgørende at dit essay kommer til at fremstå som en
sammenhængende skriftlig fremstilling. Så undgå afsnitsoverskrifter og
punktopstillinger --- men del selvfølgelig ind i afsnit.

-   Brug analyse/ fagbegreber

-   **Undgå referat**: Du må ikke bare gengive direkte hvad der står i
    teksten. Du skal forklare hvad en bestemt passage eller virkemiddel
    i teksten bidrager med.

-   Analysen skal være **tekstnær**. Det vil sige, at den skal være
    grundigt dokumenteret med direkte citater fra teksten eller
    henvisninger til den.

-   Husk at din fortolkning hænger tæt sammen med din analyse. I
    analysen har du undersøgt detaljer i teksten og i fortolkning skal
    du samle op på alle dine observationer og sige noget mere generelt
    om teksten som helhed. Hvad fortæller teksten helt præcis om
    hovedtemaet?

-   **Der er ikke nødvendigvis én bestemt** **fortolkning** af en
    novelle. Der kan være flere mulige fortolkninger. Du skal
    kunne *argumentere for* din fortolkning ud fra teksten, og at
    den *hænger logisk sammen med* din analyse.

-   Husk at **dokumentere dine pointer**

-   Husk at forklare og **uddybe dine citater** og henvisninger. Forklar
    hvorfor du bruger citatet og hvad det bidrager med i forhold til
    analysen, fortolkning, kommentar, diskussion eller vurdering af
    teksten.

-   Husk **tragtindledning** i din indledning hvor du starter med et
    bredt perspektiv hvor temaet og emnet beskrives. Så kan du zoome ind
    på den konkrete tekst og forklar hvordan teksten undersøges i
    opgaven.

.

-   Pas på: **Citaterne må ikke fylde for mege**t i din opgave. Dine
    egne ord skal fylde mest. Inddrager du et langt citat fra teksten,
    skal der også være meget at sige om det.

-   Pas på med at skrive før du har **læst teksten *meget grundig****t.*
    Din fortolkning kan godt være *forkert*, hvis du har misforstået
    teksten eller din argumentation er usammenhængende.

-   Pas på med at modsige dig selv eller teksten, når du præsenterer din
    samlede fortolkning.

-   Pas på med **personlig påstand eller holdninger uden
    argumentation**. Alle påstand om teksten skal der argumenteres
    logisk for og evt. dokumenteres med henvisninger eller citater.
    Undgå at skrive *I think that ... eller I believe that... (med
    mindre du bliver bedt om din personlig mening)* En mere objektive
    formulering er *It appears that... eller It seems that...*

-   ## Pas på med for mange stavefejl og grammatiske fejl. De kan trække ned -- på trods af en god tekstanalyse og opgavestruktur. Brug stavekontrol. **Læs korrektur når du tror du er færdig med opgaven.**

-   Pas på med **slangudtryk**. Det bør undgås

-   Pas på med konklusionen. Der er en **tæt sammenhæng mellem
    indledning og konklusionen**. Er der kommet en afklaring på
    fokuspunkterne som blev præsenteret i din indledning? Svaret behøver
    ikke at være entydigt. Men din **konklusion må ikke begynde at
    konkludere på noget som ikke er blevet undersøgt** i din essay.

-   Pas på med at **holde analysebegreberne fra fx fiktion og
    non-fiktion adskilt**. (fiktionstekster bruger fx narrator mens
    non-fiction normalt ikke gøre)

 Used correctly, discourse markers - or paragraph linkers - will greatly
improve the argument and logic of an essay. They will help the reader
understand the structure of your argument, they will make your points
clearer - and they will make the connecting thread (\"den røde tråd\")
in your essay more easily visible.

The list below is by no means an exhaustive list of discourse markers.
It is merely a short list of tools to improve your essay and argument
structure.

  **on the other hand**          Dickens\' text, on the other hand, seems very dark.
  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
  **while/whereas**              While/whereas Dickens uses imagery, Jason Kennedy
                                 uses irony.

  **however**                    The narrator, however, reads Camus.

  **nevertheless**               Nevertheless, the text ends on a hopeful note.

  **similarly**                  Similarly, the Kinks\' song deals with a man who has
                                 a very repetitive job.

  **on the contrary**            The narrator is not like the other workers. On the
                                 contrary, he is an individual.

  **first of                     There are several themes in the text. First of all,
  all\...secondly\...finally**   the text is about\...secondly it deals with\...and

  **in general**                 In general, factory work is described as
                                 uninspiring.

  **apart from**                 Apart from the narrator, all the workers seem
                                 strange.

  **for instance**               He shows his discontent. For instance, he says that
                                 \"\...\"

  **therefore**                  He is unhappy. Therefore he quits.

  **in other words**             He reads Camus. In other words, he is interested in
                                 existentialism.

  **to sum up**                  To sum up, the texts all deal with the problems of a
                                 mechanised existence.

  **in short**                   In short, the theme is man vs. machine.

**[STYLE in connection with fiction and non-fiction]{.ul}**

Style of language can be divided into two subgroups of style:

High/formal style

Low / informal style

**High / formal style of language is characterized by:**

-   Longer sentences

-   Correct grammar

-   Varied vocabulary

-   Use of subordinate clauses

-   Varied sentence structure

-   Few repetitions

-   Third person use

-   Neutral tone

**Low / informal style is characterized by:**

-   Short sentences

-   Mainly main clauses

-   Less varied vocabulary

-   Repetitions

-   Use of fillers

-   Alternate and incorrect spelling and grammar

-   Little variation in sentence structure

-   Contractions (such as I'll, you'd, ain't, won't)

-   First person use

-   Personal tone (the use of we and I)

**Examples of high and low style**

**High style**

-   Students are expected to use grammar and punctuation correctly.

**Low style**

-   Well, students usually try to use correct grammar and punctuation,
    you know.

**Exercise: High / Low style**

1.  Create 3 sentences. Try to write each sentence in both high and low
    style.

2.  In pairs: Try to write a short text message about your plans this
    coming weekend -- one writes a text message to a parent or
    grandparent -- the other writes a text message to a best friend.
    Read them aloud to each other and discuss the choice of words and
    where the two text messages differ.
