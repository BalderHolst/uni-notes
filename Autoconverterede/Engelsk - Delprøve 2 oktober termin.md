|                                                                       |
| **Eksempel:** Gavin cooked for Kay...                                 |
|                                                                       |
| Gavin **cooks** for Kay...                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Gavin **cooks** for Kay at his house that evening, opening tins and   |
| crushing garlic with a sense of ill-usage.                            |
|                                                                       |
| After a row, you **have** to say certain things to secure a truce:    |
| those **are** the rules, everyone **knows** that. Gavin **has**       |
| telephoned Kay from his car on the way back from Barry's burial and   |
| **tells** her \[...\] that he **hopes** he **can** see her that       |
| night. He **considers** these humble admissions no more or less than  |
| the price he **has** to pay for an evening of undemanding             |
| companionship.                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| But Kay **seems** to consider them more in the light of a down        |
| payment on a renegotiated contract. *You **miss** me. You **need** me |
| when you **are** upset. You're sorry we **don't** go as a couple.     |
| Well let's not make that mistake again.* There **has** been a certain |
| complacency about the way she **has** treated him since; a briskness, |
| a sense of renewed expectation.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| He **is** making spaghetti Bolognese tonight; he **has** deliberately |
| omitted to buy a pudding or to lay the table in advance; he **is** at |
| pains to show her that he **has** not made much of an effort. Kay     |
| **seems** oblivious, even determined to take this casual attitude as  |
| a compliment. She **sits** at his small kitchen table, talking to him |
| over the pitter-patter of rain on the skylight, her eyes wandering    |
| over the fixtures and fittings. She **has** not often been here.      |
