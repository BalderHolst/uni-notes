**Fear**

Nearly every morning, a certain woman in our community comes running out
of her house with her face white and her overcoat flapping wildly. She
cries out, "Emergency, emergency", and one of us runs to her and holds
her until her fears are calmed. We know she is making it up; nothing has
really happened to her. But we understand, because there is hardly one
of us who has not been moved at some time to do just what she has done,
and every time it has taken all our strength, and even the strength of
our friends and families too to quiet us.
