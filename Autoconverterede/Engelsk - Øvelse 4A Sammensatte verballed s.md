**Lonely**

No one is calling me. I can't check \[I cannot check\] the answering
machine because I have been here all this time. If I go out, someone may
call while I'm out. Then I can check the answering machine when I come
back in.

**Enlightened**

I don't know \[I do not know\] if I can remain friends with her. I've
thought \[I have thought\] and thought about it -- she'll never know
\[will never know\] how much. I gave it one last try. I called her after
a year. But I didn't like \[did not like\] the way the conversation
went.....
