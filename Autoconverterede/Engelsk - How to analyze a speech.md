**How to analyze a speech**

Here are a number of things you should look for when you are to analyze
a speech. Beware that if you have the speech on video (or in an audio
file) --- as you may have, for instance, in your exam assignment ---
there will be additional text-external elements to look for in terms of
appearance, self presentation and impression management.

**Communication situation**

Who is speaking to whom on what occasion, in what language and with what
intention?

Take notes to each heading in the rhetorical pentangle:

Speaker: What do you know/what can you find out about the speaker as a
person?

Audience: What sort of people constitute the audience?

Circumstances: On what occasion is the speech made? Under what
circumstances (physically/politically/etc.)?

Topic: What is the speech about?

Language: What sort of language (vocabulary, style, syntax) does the
speaker use?

Intention: Based on the above, what seems to be the intention of the
speaker? What is his purpose?

**Content/topic**

What is the speech about?

Give a brief outline.

**Structure**

Introduction -- body -- conclusion

Is there a governing idea running through the speech?

**Coherence**

Do the various parts of the speech relate logically?

**Cohesion**

How are the individual parts tied together?

What connecting words are used?

How does referencing work? (e.g. use of personal pronouns)

**Stylistic devices**

Repetition

Imagery

Contrast

Irony/sarcasm

**Modes of persuasion/forms of appeal**

Logos

Pathos

Ethos

**Selection of words**

Word classes:

Verbs

Nouns

Adjectives

High/low style

Technical/specialized/professional language

**Syntax**

Short/long sentences

Hypotaxis/parataxis

**Text-external factors**

Appearance:

How does the speaker stand or move about?

How is the speaker dressed?

Does the speaker appear emotional or detached? How?

Anything noteworthy about the speaker\'s gestures?

Anything noteworthy about the speaker\'s facial expressions?

Which of the above do you consider circumstantial?

Which do you consider part of a strategy for self presentation or
impression management
