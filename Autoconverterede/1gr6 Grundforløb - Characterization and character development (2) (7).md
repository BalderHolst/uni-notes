**CHARACTERIZATION AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT**

Write an essay (about 600-700 words) in which you compare **how the
characters develop** in the two short stories *Indian Camp* and *Just
Like That*.\
\
Use this structure for your essay:

1.  Opening -- in which you introduce your topic -- try not to use
    sentences like 'In this essay, I will write about...' Instead,
    introduce the *topic* of the essay. For instance:\
    - The two short stories, xxx, and xxx, are both about...\
    - In the two short stories, xxx, and, xxx, the focus is on...\
    - The theme Growing Up is depicted in the two short stories, xxx,
    and xxx...

2.  Character development in *Indian Camp* -- focus on Nick

*der var et billede her engang*
    height="2.7930555555555556in"}Character development in *Just Like
    That* -- focus on the boy.

4.  Comparison. Look at similarities and differences.

Make sure that you base your characterizations on the text and not on
your opinion. Use examples from the text to support your statements --
her var et link til en lokal filby [quoting]{.ul} directly from the texts.

To paraphrase]{.ul}: at genfortÃ¦lle/gengive

[To quote]{.ul}: at citere

*der var et billede her engang*

NB! Don't use more than two short quotes in your essay.
