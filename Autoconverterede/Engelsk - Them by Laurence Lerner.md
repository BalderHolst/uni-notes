Them

By Laurence Lerner

Parking is never easy. One old woman

Easing her buttocks on a bench, stares, smiles.

Window to window, turn: I scrape the bumper.

Three loud teenagers platform on the pavement.

Their limp inadequate skirts lift as they leap.

All that vitality is mine. Is mine.

Block the car, give back the woman's smirk.

A football leaves a child's caressing foot.

A man in tie and briefcase lifts the skirts

With fingering eyes. Their youth, the leather shreds

Unfolding from the football, his lust bursting,

Are mine mine mine.

Three streets away I stop, take out my watch.

And nod. Ten minutes. Almost time to telephone.

The girls will be deflowered, the smile wiped off,

The shredded tie smeared on a bursting window,

The shreds of car unfolding in their flesh.

So much for lust, complacency of youth.

And age's envy. And so much for them.

"You have five minutes' warning. Clear the street"
