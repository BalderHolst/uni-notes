| **Eksempel:** The evening sun middled the sky...                      |
|                                                                       |
| The evening sun **middles** the sky......                             |
+=======================================================================+
| The evening sun **middles** the sky like a piece of glowing coal      |
| taken out of fire and left to cool down. It **holds** back its        |
| flames, yet **makes** sure to cast its blazing shadows on the         |
| surroundings before it **sets**. I **fly** closer and closer to the   |
| sun, yet it **doesn\'t** hurt me to come that close. It **is** a cold |
| sun, old, just like myself; and as I **am** starting my voyage, it    |
| **is** getting ready to leave for another destination.                |
|                                                                       |
| The vast space **is** **embracing** in perfect stillness, void of any |
| movement except for the nomadic birds passing by, greeting me with a  |
| side glance or a wag of tail. Beneath me **are** scattered oil ships  |
| and fishing boats that **appear** from above like puffs of cloud      |
| floating in a lower sky; a perfect reflection of my upper             |
| surroundings.                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| It **dawns** on me that I **am** completely alone -- no humans, no    |
| nothing. I **feel** alarmingly free, and that **scares** me, and the  |
| only way to shake the fear **is** to keep on flying towards nowhere;  |
| and I **do** it for long hours until there **is** no light to be      |
| seen, except for the navigational beam of the distant lighthouse, and |
| some glowing unidentified shapes beneath me.                          |
|                                                                       |
| After long aimless flying, I **give** in to fatigue. My stomach       |
| **rumbles** with hunger. I **need** somewhere to land and something   |
| to eat. A couple of scattered boats beneath me **glow** amid the      |
| darkness. *One of these boats will do*, I **think**.                  |
|                                                                       |

| **Summary:**                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| Carlyle is a gas station owner in a small town in North Carolina. One |
| day a soiled woman shows up after closing time. At first Carlyle does |
| not let her in and begins sweeping the store. When the woman does not |
| leave, he asks her what she wants. She tells him that she was thrown  |
| out of the car and has no one who can come pick her up. He lets her   |
| in. After cleaning herself up and resting for a while, as she softly  |
| sings along to the radio. Carlyle offers to pay for a bus ticket for  |
| her to get back to home. They drive to the bus station where he pays  |
| for her ride home with a few bucks to spare. We flash forward two     |
| years. Carlyle hears a familiar voice in the radio. It is the woman   |
| who now has a successful music carrier.                               |

| **Analytical essay**                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| The short story "Last Bridge Burned" by Ron Rash is set in a small    |
| town called Asheville in North Carolina. The main character, Carlyle  |
| owns a gas station in the little town. Here nothing ever changes,     |
| everything is repeating itself every day. Even the cat comes to check |
| if Carlyle has left a can of fish for it in a daily basis.            |
|                                                                       |
| The title "Last Bridge Burned" emphasises the absolute hopelessness   |
| of the woman when she shows up at the gas station. She has absolutely |
| nothing, and no one is there for her anymore. At least, that is what  |
| she believes but just by presenting herself, she finds someone        |
| willing to help. She is startled by this, which we can see in line 22 |
| -- 24:                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| "What do you expect in return?"                                       |
|                                                                       |
| "Nothing."                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| "Nothing?"                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| She is so used to people wanting something in return that she expects |
| that of everyone. Perhaps that is why she was kicked out of the car;  |
| she did not give them what they wanted in return for being her friend |
| or maybe just for driving her home. Carlyle's simple act of kindness  |
| sends her spiralling upwards and onwards in life. Which certainly is  |
| not why Carlyle does it.                                              |
|                                                                       |
| When the woman shows up, she disturbs Carlyle's cycle and only        |
| reluctantly, he lets her in. Carlyle is a man of order and structure; |
| therefore, he does not like to be disrupted in his routine. He does   |
| his best to live by his father's advice: "trouble finds a man easy    |
| enough without you inviting it in" (line 6-7), and every time in his  |
| life that he has ignored it, as in getting married, his life has      |
| become worse. He would much rather just live by himself in peace      |
| without the trouble that comes with having people in your life.       |
| Therefore, he finds the situation unsettling and desperately tries to |
| conserve his usual habits, but this woman needs help, and it would be |
| just as disruptive to his daily schedule, if he had to think about    |
| whether he should have been better to her, as it would be to let her  |
| stay with him, so he ends up helping her get home. It costs him sixty |
| dollars, a pair of flipflops and a cup of coffee, but that is a small |
| price to pay to be contempt with life.                                |
|                                                                       |
| And this is the main theme of the short story: success and life       |
| satisfaction. Carlyle is perfectly happy with his current position in |
| life, with no one there to cause him trouble. He is contempt with     |
| living the same day over and over again in a rural town, which name   |
| says everything you have to know about it: "Asheville", as if someone |
| set fire to it, and what now exists are only the sad remains. Still   |
| Carlyle finds joy in life as he watches the cars pass on the highway  |
| at night. The woman on the other hand, has hit rick bottom. She is    |
| without shoes and standing on a stranger's doorstep in need of help.  |
| She is desperate and does not think that anyone would be kind enough  |
| to help her. Just as Carlyle, she does not expect anything good from  |
| the world, but much like him, she still ends up successful in her own |
| way.                                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| "Last Bridge Burned" is a short story about success and life          |
| satisfaction, it tells the story of two very different people, who    |
| both end up happy and successful in their own right, but in very      |
| different ways. It also shows us the impact a small deed, like        |
| helping someone in need, can have on their life and that in reality,  |
| the last bridge is never burnt.                                       |
