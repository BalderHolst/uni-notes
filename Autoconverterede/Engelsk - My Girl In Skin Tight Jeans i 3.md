**MY GIRL IN SKIN-TIGHT JEANS** (1981)

> James would like to make one thing clear before he tells his story. he
> doesn't want you to think that, because He has never married that
> there is any kind of\... of a problem between him and the female sex.
> he could in fact have married any number of girls had he so chosen -
> but he didn\'t choose to, so there it is. It was a question of his
> health, you see. He does not have a strong constitution and largely
> for that reason he decided, once his dear mother had died, to remain a
> bachelor.
>
> His mother left him a small legacy along with the house. He lives
> quietly and economically there. He has several projects with which he
> is currently occupied and they take up a fair amount of his time. He
> is a great reader too, and one of the luxuries of not having to work
> for a living is that he can indulge to the full of his passion for
> reading. Lately, howÂ­ever, he has grown rather tired of books and for
> the last year or so has read only magazines. He has subscriptions to
> thirty-eight and buy many others on a casual, sporadic basis. He reads
> all kinds except the political ones; He likes the bright, happy
> illustrations and he has been progressively coming round to the
> opinion that magazines are, indeed, more imaginative than many novels.
> The world of the glossy magazine holds more allure for him than the
> grimy realistic tragedies that pass for literature these days.
