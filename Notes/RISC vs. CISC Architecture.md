# RISC vs. CISC Architecture
**RISC**: *Reduced* Instruction Set Computer
**RISC**: *Complex* Instruction Set Computer

RISC has the following advantages
- Instructions only take one cycle time as opposed to CISC which can take multiple
- RISC is architecture simpler and therefore requires less physical space
- Easier to design

Disadvantages of RISC:
- Requires very fast memory to feed instructions as instructions take less time to execute
