# Score Test
Test the extremeness of a hypothesis given a sample by comparing the slope of the log-likelihood function at the sample and hypothesis values.

$$
t_{s} = \frac{S(\theta_{0})^{2}}{\mathcal{I}(\theta_{0})} \sim \mathcal{X}^{2}
$$
$S$: *Score function*; The first derivative of the log-likelihood function.
$\mathcal{I}(\theta_{0})$: Information matrix
