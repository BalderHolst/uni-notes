# Identity Matrix
**Square** matrix with $1$ on the diagonal and $0$ otherwise.

An identity matrix is also a diagonal matrix.
$$
I_{4\times4} =\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$

### Property

$A$ is matrix and $I$ is an identity matrix. Both are of the same size.

$$A \cdot I = I \cdot  A = A$$
