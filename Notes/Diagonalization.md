# Diagonalization
Transform a matrix into a diagonal matrix. This is useful as many matrix operations are trivial on diagonal matrixes. Here are a few:

- [[Determinanen for Matricer|finding the determinant]]
- [[Eigen values and vectors|finding eigen values and vectors]]
- [[Trace|finding trace]]

A matrix is **diagonalizable** if there exists an *invertible* matrix $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ such that
$$
D = P^{-1}AP
$$
