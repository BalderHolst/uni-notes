# Diagonalization
Transform a matrix into a diagonal matrix. This is useful as many matrix operations are trivial on diagonal matrices. Here are a few:

- Finding a power of the matrix
- [[Determinanen for Matricer|Finding the determinant]]
- [[Eigen values and vectors|Finding eigen values and vectors]]
- [[Trace|Finding trace]]

A matrix is **diagonalizable** if there exists an *invertible* matrix $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ such that
$$
D = P^{-1}AP
$$

Use [[eigendecomposition]] to calculate $P$ and $D$.
