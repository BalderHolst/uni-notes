# Nyquist Formula
Defines the *theoretical* maximum bit rate
$$V_{N} = 2 \cdot B \cdot \log_{2}(L)$$
$V_{N}$: bit rate $[\text{bit} / s]$ or $[\text{BPS}]$
$B$: the bandwidth $[\text{Hz}]$
$L$: the number of signal levels.

The $2$ is because, you always have to sample at twice the frequency of the highest signal component.
