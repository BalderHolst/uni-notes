# The State of a System
> *"The set of variables (a.k.a state variables) which at some initial time $t_0$, together with input variables, **completely** determine the behaviour of the system for time $t > t_0$."*
> \- Ronald S. Burns, Advanced Control Engineering

## State variables
The *smallest number of states required to describe the dynamic nature of a system*. These variables do not have to be measureable.

## State Space
The n-dimensional space where state variables change as a function of time.
