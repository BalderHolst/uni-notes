# Pulse Sampling
See [[Lektion 2 - Sampling og Rekonstruktion.pdf#page=33|slides]].

[[Impulse Sampling]] is the ideal theoretical way of sampling a signal. However, in the real world our sample pulses have a duration, which leads to imperfect sampling.

#### Duty Factor
How much of the time within each sample the sample is held.
$$d= \frac{\tau}{T}, \s 0 \leq d \leq 1$$
$d$: duty factor
$\tau$: "width" of pulses
$T$: Sample Interval - "distance" between samples
