# Zeigler Nichols Tuning Method
Use if a model of the **system is not available**. Otherwise use [[Root Locus Tuning]] instead.

There are two Zeigler Nichols tuning methods:
- Zeigler Nichols Tuning method based on **step response**
- Zeigler Nichols' *Ultimate Sensitivity Method*

### Based on Step Responce
Consider a system with the following step response

The constants for a P, PI or PID controller can then be determined as follows

| Controller | PID Gains |
| ---------- | --------- |
| P          |           |
| PI         |           |
| PID        |           |
