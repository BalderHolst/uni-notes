# P-value
What is the smallest $\alpha$ level test that supports the **null hypothesis**? It is the *evidence against $H_{0}$.*

### Calculating
$$
p = \frac{C - \mu_{a}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
$p$: p-value
$C$: [[critical value]]
$\mu_{a}$: Mean given the *alternative hypothesis*
$\sigma$: Standard deviation
$n$: Number of samples
