# Plug-in Estimator
Plug in the [[Emperical CDF]] to estimate the real distribution. This plug-in estimator is *non-parametric* (is has no parameters associated with the output distribution).

We plug in the sampled $\widehat{F}_n$ instead of the *unknown* $F$.
$$
\theta = T(F) \quad\approx\quad \widehat{\theta}_{n}= T(\widehat{F}_{n})
$$
$F$: Underlying CDF
$\widehat{F}_{n}$: [[Emperical CDF]]
