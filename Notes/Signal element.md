## Signal element
The shortest unit of time that can represent a packet of bits.

A signal element can reperesent more than one bit by having more levels.

A signal that can only be HIGH or LOW, can only represent one bit pr. signal element, but a signal that can be 1V, 2V, 3V or 4V, can reperecent TWO, bits pr. signal element.

A small number of signal levels is easier to parse the signal and lessens the effectes of distortion.

### Rate of signal elements
$$S = c \cdot N \cdot \frac{1}{r}$$
$S$: rate of signal elements
