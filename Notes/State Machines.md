# State Machines
A programming construct where the program switches between states.

### Moore State Machines

Outputs depend *only on the pressent state*. The **outputs can only be written when the state changes**.

### Mealy State Machine

Outputs depend on **both input and current state**. Outputs can therefore change when the input changes without changing the state.
