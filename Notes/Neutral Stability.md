# Neutral Stability
The boundry between stability and instability.

This is the closed loop transfer funktion $H(s)$
$$
H(s) = \frac{K(s)G(s)}{1 + K(s)G(s)}
$$
$K(s)$: Regulator
$G(s)$: Plant/system

Stability is **only** determined by numerator.

Neutral stability happens at
$$L(s) = K(s)G(s) = -1$$
In polar form we get
$$
|L(s)| = 1 \quad \angle L(s) = 180\degree
$$
