# Tri-State Buffer
See slides [[Lesson 3.pdf#page=24]]

A way to connect different signals to one wire. 

If signals were connected directly together, it may result in short. The Tri-State buffer prevents this. 

An *enable signal* can make the output **completely disconnected from the input**.

Tri-State meaning $\text{HIGH}$, $\text{LOW}$ or $\text{HI-Z}$ (high [[Impedans|impedance]]/disconnected).
