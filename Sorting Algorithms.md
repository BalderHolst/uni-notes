# Sorting Algorithms
See [[Lessons/Semester 5/algorithms/lecture2.pdf|slides]].

The size of the array to be sorted is denoted as $n$.

### Insertion Sort
Insert the current number correctly in the part left of the current cursor position.

##### Time Complexity
$$O(n^2)$$
If the input is **already sorted**, the time complexity is very close to $\Theta(n)$.
