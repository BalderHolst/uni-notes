# Common Mode Rejection Ratio
How good a differential amplifier is at rejecting noise when the impedance on its inputs is the same.

$$
CMRR = 20 \log\left( \frac{|A_d|}{|A_{cm}|} \right)
$$

With a CMRR at 90dB the amplifier is 31866 times better at amplifying the difference as opposed to the noise.
