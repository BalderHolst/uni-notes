# Max Flow
The maximum flow from a *source* $s$, to a sink $t$ in a flow graph. Each edge in the graph is directed, and has a capacity. Only the allowed capacity can flow through an edge.

#### Augmenting Path
A path from $s$ to $t$ with a capacity above $0$. Can only contain edges that are not fully saturated. *The maximum flow is found when there are no more augmenting paths*.
