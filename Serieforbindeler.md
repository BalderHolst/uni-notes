### Serieforbindelser
> "In order for elements A and B to be in series, no other path for current can be connected to the node joining A and B. Thus, all elements in a series circuit have identical currents."

The direction of current flow is **IRRELEVANT**

##### Resistance ($R$)
The *sum* of resistances.
$$R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots$$

##### Strøm ($I$)
All currents are equal.
$$I_1 = I_2 = I_3 = \dots = I_n $$

##### Spænding ($V$)
$$U_{total} = U_1 + U_2 + U_3 + \dots + U_n$$
