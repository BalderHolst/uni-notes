# Transformation Matrices


## Combining Rotation and Translation

We use [[Rotational Matrices|rotational matrixes]] for rotations, and vectors for translations.

$$
\begin{align}
^{A}P &=\ ^A_{B}R \ ^BP +\ ^AP_{Aorg} \\ \\
^{A}P &=\ ^A_{B}R^{-1} \ ^BP -\ ^AP_{Borg}
\end{align}
$$

This is easy enough if we only have two or three frames, but becomes quite complicated if we have more frames.
