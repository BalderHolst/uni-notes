# Karnaugh Map (K-map)
Alternative way of representing a truth table.

Se slides: [[Lesson 3.pdf#page=30]].

The sides of a Karnaugh map "warp" around. 

### Procedure 
1. Draw the biggest rectangles you can around the $1$'s, there have to be at least two cell in each rectangle. (remember that the table "wraps")
2. For each rectangle write an equivalent equations and `OR` them together. (example [[Lesson 3.pdf#page=34|here]])
